# InterestGroups

A simple Flask/HTML project for school, where we were tasked to create a website to solve a problem students may face.
I chose to tackle Interest Groups as I often face the issue of not knowing anyone who knows / is interested in the same topic (whether it be a skill or piece of media) as I am, which sometimes makes sharing my experiences with that topic difficult.

= The Program / Website = 
You start off in the home page, "/" where you can create or find a group. Although trying to create a group while not logged in will send you straight to the Log In page, where you can click another button to create a new account if you haven't. The find button will bring you to the '/Find' page where you can see all pre-existing Groups and their info if you click the "more info" button. There is also a filter button used to filter the groups based on Category, Day and Time.
Upon entering the group page, if you are the leader (granted that you are logged in), you can edit the group information on the spot. If you are not, you can join the group. Trying to join the group while not logged in will redirect you to the Log In page to log in first. After joining a group, you can always choose to leave the group from their respective page 
In addition on the home page, you can see you account details, which includes which groups you are in / are the leader of. Clicking any of the group names (all underlined) will send you to the group's page. 
On most, if not all pages, you can log out by pressing the Log Out button in the top right corner (bottom right in the home page). All pages sans the home page also have a return to home button (or to other pages, depending on the exact page you are on) 

# NOTE: If you are not filtering by one of the categories, click "N/A" otherwise the programme will run into an error
# NOTE 2: Please don't email any of the emails in the database.db all of them are fake
